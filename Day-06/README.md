### Detailed Notes 📝

#### Vectorization Fundamentals
Explored how vectorization simplifies the code when implementing learning algorithms. It makes the code not only shorter but also significantly more efficient. By leveraging modern numerical linear algebra libraries (like NumPy) and even GPU hardware, vectorized implementations can run much faster compared to unvectorized versions.

Vectorization involves performing operations on entire arrays or matrices, instead of using explicit loops. It allows us to utilize optimized low-level implementations and take advantage of parallelism.

**Key Components:**
- Parameters represented as vectors:
  - w = [w₁ w₂ w₃] for weights
  - x = [x₁ x₂ x₃] for features
  - b as a scalar bias term
- Non-vectorized implementation uses loops:
  ```python
  f = w[0]*x[0] + w[1]*x[1] + w[2]*x[2] + b
  ```
- Vectorized version uses dot product:
  ```python
  f = np.dot(w,x) + b
  ```

#### Performance Benefits

**Advantages:**
- Shorter code
- Faster execution
- Parallel computation of element-wise operations
- Efficient memory usage
- Leverages optimized linear algebra libraries
- Scales well with large datasets
- Potential GPU acceleration

**Example of Speed Improvement:**
- Without vectorization: Sequential operations at times t₀, t₁, ..., t₁₅
- With vectorization: Single parallel operation computing all multiplications simultaneously

#### Gradient Descent Implementation

**Vectorized Updates:**
- Parameters update: w = w - 0.1*d
- Learning rate (α) = 0.1
- Derivatives stored in vector d
- Single operation updates all parameters simultaneously

#### Mathematical Notation

**Improved Notation:**
- Traditional: w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ as separate variables
- Vector notation: w = [w₁ ... wₙ]
- Model function: f(x) = w·x + b
- Simplified gradient descent expressions

#### Multiple Feature Gradient Descent
Studied the mathematical intuition behind gradient descent and how it works for multiple features. Implemented gradient descent using vector operations, which helps in efficiently updating the parameters in each iteration.

**Implementation Details:**
- Handles n ≥ 2 features
- Simultaneous update of all parameters
- Vectorized computation of partial derivatives
- Batch gradient descent with m training examples

#### Normal Equation: An Alternative Approach
 Learned about the normal equation as an alternative approach to solve linear regression problems without using gradient descent. This method directly computes the optimal parameters.

**Key Points:**
- Analytical solution specific to linear regression
- Directly solves for optimal w, b without iterations
- One-shot calculation vs. iterative gradient descent

**Advantages:**
- No need to choose learning rate
- No iteration required
- Works well for smaller feature sets

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited to linear regression only
- Computationally expensive for large feature sets (>10,000 features)
- Doesn't generalize to other learning algorithms

**Important Note:**
- While available in many ML libraries, gradient descent remains the recommended approach
- Understanding both methods helps in choosing the right tool for specific scenarios
