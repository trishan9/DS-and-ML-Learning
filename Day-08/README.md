#### Initial Data Exploration
- Key functions for first look:
  - `.head()`: Preview first few rows
  - `.info()`: Get overview of data types and missing values
  - `.describe()`: Summary statistics for numerical columns
  - `.value_counts()`: Count categorical values
  - `.dtypes`: Check data types

#### Data Cleaning & Imputation
- Handling Missing Data:
  - Detection using `.isna().sum()`
  - Strategies:
    1. Drop if < 5% missing
    2. Impute with mean/median/mode
    3. Group-based imputation
- Outlier Management:
  - Detection using IQR method
  - Visualization with boxplots
  - Decision points: remove, transform, or keep
  - Impact on distribution and analysis

#### Relationships in Data
- Time-based Analysis:
  - Converting to DateTime using `pd.to_datetime()`
  - Extracting components (year, month, day)
  - Visualizing temporal patterns

- Correlation Analysis:
  - Using `.corr()` for numerical relationships
  - Visualization with heatmaps
  - Understanding correlation strength and direction

- Categorical Relationships:
  - Cross-tabulation with `pd.crosstab()`
  - KDE plots for distribution comparison
  - Categorical variables in scatter plots using hue

#### Practical Applications
- Feature Generation:
  - Creating new columns from existing data
  - Binning numerical data with `pd.cut()`
  - Extracting datetime features

- Hypothesis Generation:
  - Avoiding data snooping/p-hacking
  - Using EDA to form testable hypotheses
  - Understanding limitations of exploratory analysis

#### Key Takeaways üîë
- EDA is crucial first step in data science workflow
- Balance between cleaning and analysis is important
- Visualization helps identify patterns and relationships
- Always consider statistical significance
- EDA should lead to actionable insights or hypotheses
