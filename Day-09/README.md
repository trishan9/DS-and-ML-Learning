## Day 9
### Topic: Simple Linear Regression in Python & R
*Date: October 11, 2024*

**Today's Learning Objectives Completed ‚úÖ**
- Mastered Simple Linear Regression concepts
- Understood Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method
- Implemented regression in both Python and R
- Visualized and analyzed training/test results

### Detailed Notes üìù

**Simple Linear Regression Fundamentals**
- Linear regression predicts continuous output (y) based on input features (x)
- Model equation: ≈∑ = b‚ÇÄ + b‚ÇÅx
  - b‚ÇÄ: y-intercept (bias)
  - b‚ÇÅ: slope (coefficient)
- Used for predicting numerical values (e.g., salary based on years of experience)

**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Method**
- Goal: Minimize sum of squared residuals
- Residual: Difference between actual (y·µ¢) and predicted (≈∑·µ¢) values
- Formula: minimize Œ£(y·µ¢ - ≈∑·µ¢)¬≤
- Finds optimal values for b‚ÇÄ and b‚ÇÅ that best fit the data

**Implementation Highlights**

**Python Implementation:**
```python
# Key steps:
1. Data preprocessing
   - Loaded salary data using pandas
   - Split features (X) and target (y)

2. Handling missing values
   - Used SimpleImputer with mean strategy

3. Train-test split
   - 70-30 split ratio
   - Random state set for reproducibility

4. Model training
   - Used sklearn's LinearRegression
   - Fitted on training data

5. Visualization
   - Created scatter plots with seaborn
   - Added regression line for predictions
```

**R Implementation:**
```r
# Key steps:
1. Data loading and splitting
   - Used caTools for splitting
   - 70-30 ratio maintained

2. Model fitting
   - Used lm() function
   - Formula: Salary ~ YearsExperience

3. Visualization
   - Used ggplot2 for plotting
   - Created separate plots for training and test sets
```

**Key Insights üí°**
- Linear regression works well for this salary prediction case
- The relationship between experience and salary is approximately linear
- Model generalizes well from training to test data
- Both Python and R implementations showed similar results
